1. Concurrently: we install this npm package using the command npm i concurrently, this package will let us start our server along with our react application using one command in one terminal, So we don't have to create two terminals and start both of them one by one even though doing this wouldnt make that much difference doing it with two terminals will be perfectly fine but we can do it using one command with concurrently, to start a server and react application using one command we just add one script object in our package.json "both": "concurrently \"npm run start\" \"nodemon backend/index.js\""  now we can do npm run both in the terminal and it will start the server and the react application together
